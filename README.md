# YazooTribute
Description
This is a kind of a fun Project. It's a small tribute site to the English Pop Duo from the 80's Yazoo. (in the US called YAZ for copyright reasons).
I just grabbed some text from Wikipedia and a bunch of photos. I used a great tool as fancybox for the image gallery.
I added some hover effect on the pics. The site is completely responsive.
Technologies used:
Flexbox, Fancybox, Mobile first approach
